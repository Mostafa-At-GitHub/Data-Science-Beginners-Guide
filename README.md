Hello and welcome to the Data Science Beginners Guide
I originally built this repository so that It will be helpful for my process of learning. Through building the repo I realized that other people might be also be interested in this content - so I have tried to curate content on data science topics, high quality resources to learn from, and relevant blog posts.  

The intended goal was to cover more than just the technical component  of data science.  Data Science as a discipline is still relatively fresh and many business are learning how to properly integrate and structure those teams and also proper understanding the value proposition that data science can provide.

As a result I also tried to find topics that cover building data science teams, business practices, use-cases, product metrics and data science career paths.  

This is a constant work in progress and I hope to refactor and update in some kind of meaningful time frame.

If you find this resource helpful - please send it around to other people or you can [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamsivab/), share it on linkedIn, twitter, Facebook, add it to Quora or just send me a note.   Good luck, I hope this helps you find what you are looking for now, or in the future.
